# Legacy Changelog

## Gap in data

This is missing stuff between the one above and the one below.

## 20230120-1: New Account Events

This update adds two new events:

- `UserPlatformWipe { user_id: String; flags: Int; }`
- `Auth { event_type: 'DeleteSession' | 'DeleteAllSessions'; [..] }` (see [Auth](/stack/bonfire/events#auth))

It also adds a new user flag of value `8` which represents a user who has been flagged and removed as spam.

It also adds one REST routes:

- `GET /users/<user_id>/flags`: Fetch user flags

If your account is disabled, login will no longer throw an error, instead it will return `Disabled { user_id: String }` with status code 200.

You must now also specify a list of reactions when enabling restrict reactions.

## 20220903-1: Changes to role colours, masquerades, members and user timeouts

Role colours now support most valid CSS gradients and colours up to 128 characters and which satisfy the following Regex:

```regex
(?i)^(?:[a-z ]+|var\(--[a-z\d-]+\)|rgba?\([\d, ]+\)|#[a-f0-9]+|(repeating-)?(linear|conic|radial)-gradient\(([a-z ]+|var\(--[a-z\d-]+\)|rgba?\([\d, ]+\)|#[a-f0-9]+|\d+deg)([ ]+(\d{1,3}%|0))?(,[ ]*([a-z ]+|var\(--[a-z\d-]+\)|rgba?\([\d, ]+\)|#[a-f0-9]+)([ ]+(\d{1,3}%|0))?)+\))$
```

You can now also masquerade role colours per-message, simply include the `colour` property matching the properties above.

All members now include a `joined_at` property which indicate when the timestamp at which they joined a certain server.

All members now also have a `timeout` property which can be changed by `PATCH /servers/<server_id>/members/<user_id>`, users will not be able to interact with the server until the time expires. A visual indicator will also display on the user's end as well as for others in chat:

## 20220608-1: Friends API v2

- `PUT /users/{target}/friend`: Accept friend request where `{target}` is an ID
- `POST /users/friend`: Send friend request (with body `{ username: string }`)

The old route will stop accepting usernames in a week, see [20220608-2](/changes/20220608-friends-api-v1-deprecation).

## 20220608-2: 'Send Friend' Deprecation

The `PUT /users/{target}/friend` route will stop accepting usernames in place of `{target}`.
